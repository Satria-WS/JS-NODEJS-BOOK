$ npm init





note : 
Before we run npm install express, npm requires that we have a file
package.json to track all packages and their versions used in our app.

run npm install express now without the file, you will get a series of warnings
like “ no such file or directory, open … package.json ” .

syntax code:

{
"name": "node",
"version": "1.0.0",
"description": "",
"main": "index.js",
"scripts": {
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
},
"author": "",
"license": "ISC"
}
